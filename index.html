                    <p>
                        I studied Mechanical Engineering and minored in Computer Science at The Cooper Union where 
                        I graduated in May 2022. After graduated I worked for a LIDAR company in San Francisco, 
                        where I got experience with hardware testing and programming collaboration. I joined this 
                        boot camp because I wanted to improve my programming skills in a more consistent manner than 
                        teaching myself, and I wanted to take advantage of the career resources. Outside of 
                        programming I enjoy photography, aquariums, and bar trivia.
